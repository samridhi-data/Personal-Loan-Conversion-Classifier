# Personal-Loan-Conversion-Classifier
Use Case:
The bank aims to convert its liability customers (depositors) into personal loan customers while retaining their deposits.
Last year's marketing campaign targeting liability customers achieved a conversion rate of over 9%, prompting the retail marketing department to devise more effective campaigns with minimal budgets.

Objective:
The objective is to build a machine learning model that predicts whether a customer would take up a personal loan if targeted by a marketing campaign. The model should be based on the provided dataset.

Data Set Description: A comprehensive dataset will be used, containing various customer attributes. These attributes include demographic information (age, postal code, family size), financial metrics (income, average monthly credit card spending, mortgage value), and behavioral indicators (use of internet banking, possession of investment and deposit accounts). The target variable is whether the customer accepted a personal loan in the previous campaign.

Approach taken:
To achieve this, data analysis and preprocessing will be conducted to prepare the dataset for modeling. Several machine learning models will be developed and evaluated using different performance metrics. The project will deliver Jupyter notebooks containing the code and results, along with a summary of the findings and recommendations in a report. This will provide the bank with actionable insights to optimize their marketing strategies and increase personal loan conversions.
